  # Running microservice in air gapped (offline) mode
  # If offline is enabled, user must set either modelUseHostPath or modelUsePVC and download model `lj1995/GPT-SoVITS`, i.e.
  # huggingface-cli download --local-dir-use-symlinks False --local-dir <modelUseHostPath>/lj1995/GPT-SoVITS lj1995/GPT-SoVITS
  # Choose where to save your downloaded models
  # Set modelUseHostPath for local directory, this is good for one node test. Example:
  # modelUseHostPath: /mnt/opea-models
  # Set modelUsePVC for PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC), which is suitable for multinode deployment. Example:
  # modelUsePVC: model-volume
  # You can only set one of the following var, the behavior is not defined is both are set.
  # By default, both var are set to empty, the model will be downloaded and saved to a tmp volume.
