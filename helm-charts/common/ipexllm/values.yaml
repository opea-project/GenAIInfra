# Note: Do not use (above) "replicaCount" with HPA (Chart ignores value=1 as it's k8s default)
# Note: Because HPA can sometimes change replica counts up and down rather frequently, the microservice needs to handle SIGTERM elegantly:
# - stop accepting new requests
# - handle all of its buffered requests
# - terminate after tthose have been processed
